# Expressive Word Selector

This project generates a curated list of expressive, concrete, and highly pictorial nouns suitable for use as unique, memorable identifiers (e.g., debug build versions) from a general word list. Most of the provided Python code in this project was generated by ChatGPT, including the primary embedding-based filtering logic and associated scripts.

## Overview of the Approach

The script employs semantic embedding models to filter words based on semantic similarity, dimensional reduction, and diversity constraints:

### Core Theory and Methodology

1. **Word List Filtering**:
   - The input word list is filtered to remove non-nouns, plural nouns, and other undesired words.
   - The remaining words are then processed for embedding generation.

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Each word in the word list is converted into a high-dimensional embedding vector using the [Ollama embedding service](https://ollama.ai/) (`mxbai-embed-large` model).
   - Word embeddings are cached in `CACHE_FILE` to avoid redundant computations.

3. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - Carefully designed positive and negative prompts are used to generate embeddings that represent the semantic concepts of interest:
     - **Positive Prompts** emphasize vivid, sensory-rich, visually concrete nouns (e.g., volcano, sapphire).
     - **Negative Prompts** emphasize abstract, conceptual, or generic nouns to be avoided.
   - Example words are also embedded directly to guide the selection process.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the embedding dimensions to focus on features that best separate specific, pictorial nouns from abstract concepts.

5. **Custom Scoring & Ranking:**
   - Each candidate word is assigned a custom final score computed from its PCA embedding:
     - Words similar to positive prompts and examples are scored higher.
     - Words similar to negative prompts (abstract or conceptual words) receive lower scores.

6. **Diversity Filtering (Maximal Marginal Relevance - MMR):**
   - Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is used to ensure the selected words are both highly relevant and diverse. This prevents multiple very similar words from appearing high in the ranked list.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Preparing the Word List

This script assumes you use the SCOWL word list for input words. SCOWL word lists are available here:
- [SCOWL Word Lists](http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/)

Make sure to convert the SCOWL files to UTF-8 before use (e.g., with `iconv`).

### Running the Script

1. Provide one or more word list files as arguments to the script.

2. Adjust the configurations in the Python script as needed, particularly:
   - `OUTPUT_FILTERED_WORDLIST_FILE`
   - Ollama server URL (`OLLAMA_HOST`) and model (`MODEL`)

3. Execute the script:
```sh
python expressive_word_selector.py <wordlist1.txt> [wordlist2.txt ...]
```

4. The filtered expressive word list will be saved to the specified output file.

## SCOWL Word List

This project recommends using the [SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists)](http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/) due to their comprehensiveness and cleanliness. The numbers in SCOWL filenames (e.g., `english-words.10`, `english-words.50`) represent approximate usage frequency bands, with lower numbers including more common words, and higher numbers including more obscure terms.

## Acknowledgment

Most of the code in this project was written by ChatGPT, utilizing embedding-based semantic filtering and PCA techniques for optimal results.
